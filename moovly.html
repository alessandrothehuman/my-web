                <h1>Moovly</h1>
            <p>Moovly is a mobile app allowing to connect with other people who like the same sports.

                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <p>By creating Moovly I was aiming to build a tool that would allow people to connect and do sports together.
                    The app is for everyone who wants to go outside and exercise or play a game but they don’t have any companion to do so. The key information my app communicates is that our nature as humans isn’t to live isolated indoors all day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to feel good we need to move our body and connect with your peers. There are a lot of people out there who like the same sports as you but you don’t even know it ! So there is no need to cancel your plans just because you don’t have somebody to play basketball with.
                </p>
                <p>Within a radius of a few kilometres, Moovly will find you a dozen people who like to play basketball as much as you do. The goal here is to encourage people to workout outside by giving them an intuitive tool, that would be providing activities updated on a regular basis anytime, anywhere.

                <h2>The problem</h2>
               <h3>Market is saturated</h3>
               <p>While the fitness app market is very saturated, avaible apps are designed this way that the user exercises at home individually.
               </p>
               <h3>Isolation</h3>
               <p>In today's world we spend more and more time in our flats, often alone: working, exercising, shopping, all that taking place between those same walls
               </p>
               <h3>Craving for team work</h3>
               <p>But we are forgetting that we, humans are herd animals that are craving for companionship, team work and of course competition.
               </p>
               <h3>Canceling plans?</h3>
               <p>If we like basketball and we want to go outside and play a game but none of our friends likes basketball, do we really need to cancel our plans? Of course not!

                <h2>The objective</h2>
                <p>The goal was to design the iOS and Android version of a mobile app that solves a specific user problem. My guiding principle here was to create a tool that would connect people to exercise together in such a way that it wouldn't steal user attention from finding an activity. Therefore I was aiming to keep it clear and simple so it would be easy to navigate through the content and focus on activities.
