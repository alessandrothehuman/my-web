                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <p>By creating Moovly I was aiming to build a tool that would allow people to connect and do sports together.
                    The app is for everyone who wants to go outside and exercise or play a game but they don’t have any companion to do so. The key information my app communicates is that our nature as humans isn’t to live isolated indoors all day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to feel good we need to move our body and connect with your peers. There are a lot of people out there who like the same sports as you but you don’t even know it ! So there is no need to cancel your plans just because you don’t have somebody to play basketball with.
                </p>
                <p>Within a radius of a few kilometres, Moovly will find you a dozen people who like to play basketball as much as you do. The goal here is to encourage people to workout outside by giving them an intuitive tool, that would be providing activities updated on a regular basis anytime, anywhere.

                <h2>The objective</h2>
                <p>The goal was to design the iOS and Android version of a mobile app that solves a specific user problem. My guiding principle here was to create a tool that would connect people to exercise together in such a way that it wouldn't steal user attention from finding an activity. Therefore I was aiming to keep it clear and simple so it would be easy to navigate through the content and focus on activities.
