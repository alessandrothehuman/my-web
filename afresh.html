                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>During many conversations about cooking habits 
                        I find out that people are missing an app to cook more efficiently and organise their food 
                        supplies better. As we are facing the climate and economic crisis I decided to create a recipe app that could help us to implement zero-waste habits. 
                        Afresh is a responsive web app for people who care about their money, time and food waste. 
                        The core idea is to help users to find a recipe they need easily and quickly, so they can cook asap with less costs from what they currently have in the fridge without having to go to the grocery store.

                    <h2>The challenge</h2>
                    <h3>How to use what I already have?</h3>
                    <p>People often find it hard to discover a recipe 
                    where they could use only the ingredients 
                    that they currently have in the fridge.
                </p>
                <h3>No time to search</h3>
                <p>Theyâ€™re frustrated that they have to adjust
                    the recipes by themselves when they have         
                    special dietary needs.
